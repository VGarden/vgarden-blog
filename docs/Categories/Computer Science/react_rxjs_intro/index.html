    <h1>A too short introduction to RxJS (in React)</h1>

    <p>
        The present post is aimed at introducing the basic concepts of RxJS library,
        and exploring its integration in React components.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have chosen on purpose a NodeJS-free build, and relied on CDN instead.
        This page contains the live-running demo, together with the complete source code.
    </p>
</header>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Our goal is to design a minimalist <code>Person</code> component
in React, that knows their age and their birthdate,
and renders a greeting message on screen.
The message contains the name of the person the component stands for,
and the age. For demo purposes, every date will be integers.
</p>
<p>Below is a sketch of what the component looks like, when rendered on two persons, John and Mary:</p>
<div id="app" style="border:1px solid black; padding: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:95%; text-align: center"></div>

<h2>RxJS keys</h2>

<h3>Observable pattern</h3>

<p>
RxJs is built around the Observable pattern.
Observables are objects emit changes on listeners that previously subscribed to the observable.
Other objects can subscribe to a given observable, in order to get notified on changes
and react accordingly. In RxJS, the state is not always held by the observable itself. Actually,
most observables from RxJS are stateless, lazy, and pure.
</p>
<p>
RxJS allows a wide range of built-in utilities to create Observable out of the box,
without having to re-invent them. Let us start with an elementary example:
</p>
<pre>
let timer$ = rxjs.interval(1000);
</pre>
<p><small>(If you want to run this, do not forget to include the RxJs CDN in your page, see
<a href="https://rxjs.dev/guide/installation">here</a>)</small></p>
<p>
If you try to run this code, you should see that nothing happened.
Actually, what you just did is to instantiate an observable object that is supposed to emit 
an incremented value, once every seconds. We greatly encourage the use of
<a href="https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/interval">the documentation</a> while
learning RxJS, as you can often find in them useful deprecation notes and visualisations about the
emission flow.</p>
<p>
The simplest way to use that observable, or at least the most Object-Oriented-way to do so,
is to create a subscription on it:</p>
<pre>
let timer$ = rxjs.interval(1000);
let subscription = timer$.subscribe(
    value => console.log(value)
);
</pre>
<p>You should now see on the console an incremented counter that pops once every second.
The emission never finishes, in our case.
What happened under the hood, is that you created a resource-holding, stateful object that represents
a <strong>subscription</strong> to the Observable. It's the subscription that actually holds the
counter state, and modifies its state according to the description of the observale it refers to.
The observable itself
remains stateless and lazy: unless you subscribe, there won't be emissions.</p>
<p>Since subscriptions are stateful and hold a resource, you have to think about how to clean them up!
Hopefully there is a built-in way of doing, by simply unsubscribing. In the above example,
we unsubscribe after a time-out of 5 seconds:</p>
<pre>
let timer$ = rxjs.interval(1000);
let subscription = timer$.subscribe(
    value => console.log(value)
);
setTimeout(() => subscription.unsubscribe(), 5000)
</pre>

<h3>Declarative pipelines</h3>

<p>One of the strengths of RxJS is that the library allows a form of <strong>Functional Programming</strong>,
by defining actions on observables and compose them. The RxJS library actually has a rich set of
built-ins operators, most of them designed for specific use cases.</p>
<p>As an example, let us revisit our counter by turning every emitted value to a text:</p>
<pre>
let timer$ = rxjs.interval(1000).pipe(
  rxjs.map(count => `Counter is ${count}`)
);
let subscription = timer$.subscribe(
    value => console.log(value)
);
setTimeout(() => subscription.unsubscribe(), 5000)
</pre>
<p>In the above example, we piped our original observable with a
<a href="https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/map">map operator</a> to turn it to a greeting message.
The remaining part of the code is unchanged.</p>
<p>A benefit of using declarative pipelines, instead of over-charging the handler
at the subscription level, is that you can rely on the wide range of RxJS operators available,
and compose observables in a functional way.</p>
<p>The follow example illustrates how to chain different operators, by chaining them in the pipe description:</p>
<pre>
let timer$ = rxjs.interval(1000).pipe(
  rxjs.filter(count => !!count),
  rxjs.map(count => `Counter is ${count}`),
  rxjs.map(greeting => greeting.toUpperCase())
);
let subscription = timer$.subscribe(
    value => console.log(value)
);
setTimeout(() => subscription.unsubscribe(), 5000)
</pre>
<p>Observe in this example that the initial
<code>interval(1000)</code> does emit the <code>0</code> value!
However, the pipe filters out this value using the
<a href="https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/filter">filter operator</a>,
and that emission doesn't go through the remaining part of the pipeline.
Therefore, the subscription on the resulting <code>timer$</code> doesn't see the first null-valued
greeting message. However, if you watch close enough, you should see that there is indeed a bigger delay
before the first message, which is expected.</p>

<h3>Subjects</h3>

<p>For now, observables are essentially read-only.
Subscriptions hold the actual state and a composition of different observable effects can be described
using operators. To convince yourself about that, you can try to subscribe twice to the same observable, and see
the differences in counters:</p>
<pre>
function launch(prefix) {
  rxjs.interval(1000).pipe(
    rxjs.filter(count => !!count),
    rxjs.map(count => `Counter is ${count}`),
    rxjs.map(greeting => greeting.toUpperCase())
  ).subscribe(
      value => console.log(prefix, value)
  );
}
launch("Sub 1");
launch("Sub 2");
</pre>
<p>RxJS allows users to define read-write observables, which are called <strong>Subject</strong>.
There are different implementation of the
<a href="https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/Subject">Subject</a> type in RxJS, but most of the time you'll be happy with
<a href="https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/BehaviorSubject"><code>BehaviorSubject</code>'s</a>, as they can receive an initial value and they also directly emit
on any new-coming subscription. Compared to other observables, subjects hold a state and re-emits it on-demand
(for BehaviorSubject).
</p>
<p>The following code demonstrates the behavior of Subject and BehaviorSubject. Carefully observe what happens at
subscription time.</p>
<pre>
let subject$ = new rxjs.Subject();
let sub = subject$.subscribe(console.log);
console.log("Subscription done!");

subject$.next(2022);

sub.unsubscribe();
</pre>
<pre>
let subject$ = new rxjs.BehaviorSubject(2021);
let sub = subject$.subscribe(console.log);
console.log("Subscription done!");

subject$.next(2022);

sub.unsubscribe();
</pre>
<p>Aside from their ability to receive new values with the <code>next</code> method,
Subjects behave like any other observables: you can subscribe to them, and pipe them.</p>

<h2>Integration with React</h2>

<p>React is a frontend library aimed at building applications with less efforts than in plain JavaScript.
Some key features of React are
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">automatic life-cycle management</a>
of components (via class methods or else via <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">hooks</a>),
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html">virtual DOM update</a> and
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html">reconcialiation</a>, and of course
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>: a useful add-on on top of React Core, to describe
HTML fragments with custom React components, in a XML-like syntax from within JavaScript itself.</p>

<p>React does not come with TypeScript built-in (actually, Facebook team developped
<a href="https://flow.org">their own type system</a> on top of JavaScript), and also doesn't provide native support for RxJS (contrary to Angular, for example).
In this small chapter, we are going to build a component aimed at handling observable subscriptions.
This component is fully inspired from
<a href="https://angular.io/api/common/AsyncPipe">Angular's async pipe</a>,
and its purpose is to remove the manual management
of resources (subscriptions) from the global design.</p>

<hr>

<h3>What we want: a subscriber component</h3>

<p>Before getting into the implementation, let us describe what we would like and what
are our needs.</p>
<p>RxJS observables are pure, stateless and lazy. In that sense, they are not a problem per se.
Upon subscription, they provide a value and that value could be used to render a React fragment.
We therefore expect an API of the kind:</p>
<pre>
&lt;Async observable$={the observable of interest}>{
    futureValue => (
       &lt;React.Fragment>&lt;/React.Fragment>
    )
}&lt;/Async>
</pre>
<p>This is an example of
<a href="https://reactpatterns.js.org/docs/function-as-child-component/">function-as-child</a>,
that is a pattern quite useful in React where the 
fragment tree depends on a value that is not known for now, or left at the discretion of some component internals.</p>
<p>The role of the <code>Async</code> custom component will thus be about handling the observable correctly,
that:
<ol>
    <li>Opening a subscription</li>
    <li>Give the ability to decide whether or not a value has been emitted yet</li>
    <li>Closing the subscription</li>
</ol>
We could also improve it by making sure two sequential equivalent values are not emitted twice,
to prevent too many React life-cycle triggers; however we won't go that deep in the implementation and we will
stuck to the basis only.</p>

<h3>Implementation of the subscriber component</h3>

<p>Below is the full implementation of the subscriber component. We give some details below:</p>
<pre>
function Async(props) {
    let { observable$ } = props;
    let [value, setValue] = React.useState(undefined);
    
    let rxjsRef = React.useRef(undefined);
    
    React.useEffect(() => {
        rxjsRef.current = observable$.subscribe(
            newValue => setValue(newValue)
        )
        
        return () => rxjsRef.current.unsubscribe()
    }, [observable$]);
  
    return props.children({
      loading: !value,
      value
    });
}
</pre>
<p>The component internals are rather straightforward. In every cases, we render the <code>prop.children</code>
(that is a function!) by transmitting two pieces of informations: is the value known?, and the value if any.
The <code>value</code> is stored in a React state hook, and thus modifying the value will trigger a new React
life-cycle where the component will re-render itself. We keep the RxJS subscription in a React Reference,
which <em>does not</em> trigger life-cycle loops. As soon as the observable input of the component is modified,
we use a React Effect to asynchronously subscribe to the observable (and we unsubscribe by returning
a callback after the effect,
see <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html">the documentation</a> if details are needed).
As you see, the component does nothing else with the observable, than subscribing to it and re-injecting
its value within the React life-cycle engine.</p>

<h2>The demo example</h2>

<p>Let us now see how all those new concepts can be packed together to create our demo component.</p>

<h3>A tissue of observables</h3>

<p>We start by defining some global observables, that are used as a tissue accross the application,
to emit messages and react to interactions.</p>

<p>First things first, we define a subject to keep track of whether the time should be accelerated or not:</p>
<pre>
var speedFactor$ = new rxjs.BehaviorSubject();
</pre>
<p>Next, we define an observable that emits a single 1 value, at a frequency controlled by
the state of the speed factor: on false the rate should be 1 second, on true it should be 50 milliseconds.
We do that by piping the value of <code>speedFactor$</code>, and flatMapping onto the above-studied
<code>interval</code> observable. (FlatMapping in RxJS can be done through different operators, which can be
quite confusing. We use
<a href="https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/switchMap"><code>switchMap</code></a>,
which is what we think to be the closest to an 
idiomatic flatMap of monads).</p>
<pre>
var timer$ = speedFactor$.pipe(
    rxjs.map(speedFactor => speedFactor ? 50 : 1000),
    rxjs.switchMap(speedFactor => rxjs.interval(speedFactor)),
    rxjs.map(v => 1)
)
</pre>
<p>As a final step, we keep track of the accumulation of all emissions, by
reducing with a scan:</p>
<pre>
var date$ = timer$.pipe(
    rxjs.scan((acc, v) => acc+v, 0)
)
</pre>
<p><small>Getting used to the very long list of RxJS observables, can be quite an achievement!</small></p>

<hr>

<h3>Displaying a person</h3>

<p>We can now define the <code>Person</code> component.
Every person can subscribe to the <code>date$</code> observable, but
one should keep in mind that a person also comes with an anniversary and thus,
a person's age is shifted with respect to the current date.</p>
<p>In order to describe that in an RxJS way, we locally pipe the <code>date$</code>
observable and subscribe to it:</p>
<pre>
function Person({ birthDate, name }) {
    let age$ = date$.pipe(
        rxjs.map(date => date - birthDate)
    )
    
    return (
        &lt;p>
            Hello, my name is {name}
            and I am born in {birthDate},
            &lt;br />
            and thus I am
            &lt;Async observable$={age$}>{
                ({ loading, value }) => (
                    loading && LoadingInline()
                ) || value
            }&lt;/Async>
            years old.
        &lt;/p>
    );
}
</pre>
<p>The loading-inline component is a simple placeholder:</p>
<pre>
function LoadingInline() {
    return (
        &lt;span className="loading">&hellip;&lt;/span>
    )
}
</pre>

<h3>Speeding time, and our first concurrency bug</h3>

<p>We are now going to implement the speed factor of time&hellip;
and observe our very first concurrency bugs! (it's not because you use libraries that
you shouldn't watch out!) Let us introduce our component to speed time:</p>
<pre>
function SpeedTime() {
    let [ticked, setTicked] = React.useState(false);
    
    React.useEffect(
        () => speedFactor$.next(ticked),
        [ticked]
    );
    
    return (
        &lt;p>
            &lt;label>
                Speed time:
                &lt;input type="checkbox"
                    checked={ticked}
                    onChange={e => setTicked(e.target.checked)}
                />
            &lt;/label>
        &lt;/p>
    )
}
</pre>
<p>If we run this code and play with the tick box, we should see a bug appear:
every time the box is ticked, the age comes back its initial value.
This is actually perfectly expected, and demonstrates we actually have two bugs in our current
system.</p>
<p>When we modify the state of the SpeedTime component, we are using the State hook and thus,
we trigger React life-cycle. This forces React to replay every functional component, even though
they don't change. What happens here is that our Person component has its own version of the <code>age$</code>
observable, as a local variable. The observable thus changes during the life-cycle,
and thus the <code>Async</code> component unsubscribes and re-subscribes to the next observable:
this kills the state! (Hence why it seems to always restart.)</p>
<p>We could work around this, by keeping the same observable in the Person component, through a React Memo
or a Reference. However, we have also another bug, more subtle: since two of our persons (John and Mary)
both have their own subscriptions (to their own observable, that said), they also have their own state!
So actually, we cannot prove John and Mary are computing their age based on the same date.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are going to fix those two bugs by modifying the way we handle emissions, in the observable pipe lines.
Regarding the system we are trying to build, the most idiomatic approach would be to rely on a <code>Clock</code>
object that is responsible for emitting the date:</p>
<pre>
var speedFactor$ = new rxjs.BehaviorSubject(false);
var date$ = new rxjs.BehaviorSubject();
</pre>
<pre>
function Clock() {
    let obsRef = React.useRef(
        speedFactor$.pipe(
            rxjs.map(speedFactor => speedFactor ? 50 : 1000),
            rxjs.switchMap(factor => rxjs.interval(factor)),
            rxjs.map(v => 1),
            rxjs.scan((acc, v) => acc+v, 0)
        )
    );
    return (
        &lt;Async observable$={obsRef.current}>{
            ({ loading, value }) => {
                date$.next(value);
            }
        }&lt;/Async>
    )
}
</pre>
<p>This latter code is the one used in this page. The <code>Clock</code> maintains an observable
that escapes React life-cycle detection, so that it can be reused through life-cycles without any issue.</p>

<h2>Author's words</h2>

<p>This post has been greatly inspired by videos about original Object Oriented Programming,
as a trial to make it explicit the existence of a functional tissue in the application,
used by independent standalone objects to communicate and exchange informations.</p>
<p>I also thank the Octopus, whose brain structure is a formidable source of admiration.</p>

<hr>

<p>About RxJS and React, the possibilities seem interesting. One advantage of the pattern is that 
the component changes can now occur very locally. In fact, the properties less often travel
top-down, which also reduces the need of state-holders components at the very top of the tree,
with callbacks propagated downside.</p>
<p>Compared to usual hooks, the event emission still occurs from the tissue to the objects, that is,
from the observables to the components. This means that components are truly notified when a change occurs,
and they don't have to query some service via a hook, as it is often achieved in Redux style.</p>
<p>An issue though, could be the organization of the code, as the number of global observables
might blow up. Techniques are available, though. Observables could be grouped under namespaces,
or else we could rely on inheritance of classes to implement a trait-like code sharing.</p>
