    <h1>The definition of Context Clusters explained</h1>
    
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>If you have read the previous article, you might wonder how the definition of Context Clusters came about.
      That is exactly what this article explains.</p>

    <h2>The Cluster Tree</h2>
    <p>Besides a management of context amounts, there are also practicalities to consider when using clusters in programming languages.
      There was one criterium that was quite central: which is that a codebase can be any DAG (directed acyclic graph).
      This is where folder systems fall short; they are only capable of representing trees. 
      Even though trees do limit context in a hierarchical fashion, I do not consider it expressive enough to model codebases.
      So that is the first criterium: making the cluster finding algorithm work on any DAG.
      The secondary idea is that the combination of clusters should form a tree, and not a DAG.
      When you truly want to have clusters form a DAG, which is not per so a tree, the semantics of your codebase do not make sense anymore.
      To explain this, let's take a look at an example.</p>
