    <h2>Intro<H2>
    <p>The last year I have thought a lot about a very big problem in programming: keeping a codebase in a comprehendible state.
      Having a comprihendable program is important, because the converse is a very big problem in software engineering, known as spaghetti code.
      I would also argue that a lot if not most of scalability issues come from not keeping the comprehendible state when adding code.
      This comprehendible state seems to vanish when having too much context to think about when reading code.
      To counter the unnecessary context, code can be separated into independant parts. We will define a method for separating a codebase in this article.
